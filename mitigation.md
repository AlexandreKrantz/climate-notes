# Mitigation: The Big Picture
We need to stop increasing the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere to halt global warming. This can only be done if we reduce the GHG emissions from our activities.

## How to Reduce Emissions
1. Identify all the significant sources of emissions associated with a certain activity, manufacturing process, product, etc
2. Identify/calculate the current green premiums required to make a net zero switch
3. Research in the important areas with significant green premiums
4. Bring competitively-price emissions-free alternatives to market
