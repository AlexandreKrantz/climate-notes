### [Climate Explainer: Article 6 (worldbank.org)](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2022/05/17/what-you-need-to-know-about-article-6-of-the-paris-agreement)
- It is estimated that trading in carbon credits could reduce the cost of implementing countries’ Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) by more than half – by as much as [$250 billion by 2030](https://www.ieta.org/resources/International_WG/Article6/CLPC_A6%20report_no%20crops.pdf).  
- Article 6 of the Paris Agreement allows countries to voluntarily cooperate with each other to achieve emission reduction targets set out in their NDCs. This means that, under Article 6, a country (or countries) will be able to transfer carbon credits earned from the reduction of GHG emissions to help one or more countries meet climate targets.
- [Climate Warehouse](https://www.theclimatewarehouse.org/) is a World Bank program that aims to create an IT system for carbon markets that is true to the decentralized, bottom-up spirit of the Paris Agreement.
- Standardized registry system for tracking emissions // carbon credits. Connects multiple different registries together using blockchain technology.   
- Will be operational in 2022.   
- Open source, transparent governance 

### [Agreement Reached on International Carbon Credit Trading Rules at COP26 | CLS Blue Sky Blog (columbia.edu)](https://clsbluesky.law.columbia.edu/2021/12/20/agreement-reached-on-international-carbon-credit-trading-rules-at-cop26/)
- At Cop26 the rules for implementing Article 6 were agreed upon. 
- UN-certified carbon credit that can be traded globally and counted towards NDCs.   
- Uniform standards  
- Supervisory body that will deal with the creation and maintenance of the international carbon trading marketplace. Expected to hold at least 2 meetings in 2022.
- The rules implementing Article 6 do not contain an enforcement mechanism, and rely instead on the good faith of the participants. 
- Currently we have various different government and voluntary carbon credit markets around the world with varying degrees of authenticity. A task for the supervisory body will be to ensure that the credits of the international carbon market meet certain minimum standards.
