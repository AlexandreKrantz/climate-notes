### [Assessing the authenticity of national carbon prices: A comparison of 31 countries - ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378022000632) 
Revised and Accepted 11 April 2022 - Global Environmental Change Journal

### Key points
- Most CPIs involve low price rates, incomplete emissions coverage, and price reductions for particular sectors.
- The report assesses the authenticity of 31 national carbon prices, calculating average carbon prices and their gap with advertised prices, at both national and sector levels.  
- The results indicate a poor level of authenticity. Prices on the World Bank dashboard differ greatly from the average prices in countries.
- There is not a consistent relationship between advertised and average carbon prices.

### More info
- **Advertised carbon price**: The most common figure referenced with regards to the strength of pricing instruments is the uppermost price rate implemented on emissions covered in a jurisdiction, before discounts are permitted.     
	- This is the nominal price used by the World Bank for their carbon pricing dashboard. 
	- OCED reports also use this price and refers to it as the standard rate. 
- **Effective rate**: The sum of implicit and explicit carbon prices. Implicit carbon prices include other regulations/limitations for pollution that aren’t just a carbon tax or ETS. It is possible to calculate a rough estimate of the additional cost that this adds for producers. 
	- Implicit prices could be, for example, general energy taxes that aren’t going after emissions intensity directly.

	- The majority of carbon prices average below €10 and the highest, Norway, is still below €40.
	- Across all countries, the mean economy-wide price per ton of CO2 equals €7.90, which is considerably lower than the mean advertised price of €18.68.

	- ETSs are shown to have an extremely low contribution to pricing in the ‘road transport’, ‘agriculture & fishing’ and ‘residential & commercial’ sectors, where carbon taxes are most prevalent. 
	- For the ‘industrial’ and ‘electricity’ sectors, where the ETS contribution is greatest, the carbon tax contribution is far lower. 
	- The ‘other transport’ sector is unique in that there are similar levels of contribution from both instruments. This reflects that ETSs and carbon taxes are implemented in a complementary fashion between sectors.
	- By far the highest authenticity is found in the electricity sector, where the average price is almost €3 higher and the price gap at least three times lower than in any other sector.

	- The key takeaway from Figure 5 is that the implicit prices tend to dominate the explicit ones in most countries.    
	- South Korea, Finland, Sweden, France and Norway are the only countries where carbon price rates are greater than 25% of effective carbon rates. 
	- The figure shows that there is no clear correlation between the explicit carbon price and the overall effective carbon rate, i.e. countries with high explicit carbon prices do not necessarily have high effective rates. 
- **Average carbon price**: The average price paid per ton of CO2 is calculated by dividing the total carbon price paid in the country by the total emissions of the country. This average price can then be compared to the advertised price, to assess its authenticity.
	- In practice, countries tend to charge multiple rates in the implementation of the tax, often associated with specific sectors.

	- The majority of implicit prices are focused in the ‘road transport’ sector, where rates are six or more times higher than in any other sector. In contrast, implicit prices were shown to be much lower in the ‘industrial’ and ‘electricity’ sectors, where explicit carbon prices dominate implicit ones. Therefore we would expect sectors would differ in reactivity to an explicit carbon price. 

### Thoughts
- While we find low average carbon prices, recent empirical studies indicate these have already been quite effective in reducing emissions or curtailing emissions growth. Since all these results are for rather weak carbon prices, one should expect considerable emissions reduction with higher carbon prices.  
- Currently low carbon prices are due to climate policy being predominantly unilateral in nature, despite the Paris Agreement. Harmonizing explicit carbon prices among countries, such as is already happening through ETS systems, will encourage substitution of widespread non-carbon energy taxes by carbon taxes, facilitating an international comparison through explicit carbon prices. This in turn will allow for a gradual transition to coordination or even harmonization of effective carbon prices around the world, notably if aided by expanding coalitions and border carbon tariffs as contemplated by the EU. In turn, this could support rising carbon price rates necessary to achieve sufficient global emissions reduction.
- Countries like the EU and Canada need to take the lead and implement a transparent, high-coverage, and rising carbon price. Pair this with Article 6 International ETS credit trade, BCAs, and there is a significant incentive for other countries to bring about similar explicit carbon pricing systems. A good start would be transitioning the implicit carbon prices to comparable explicit ones. 
- Shifting the discussion from advertised to lower equivalent average carbon prices, can make it easier to garner support for price increases.
