### About the IPCC
- The IPCC report is not original research â€“ it is an assessment of current research by researchers and experts.

### Confidence Terminology
- In the IPCC reports,confidence is expressed qualitatively and tells us how certain we are that scientific findings are valid (aka accuracy). The level of confidence is determined by the type, amount, quality and consistency of evidence.

- Results with low confidence should be treated as areas that need further investigation.
- High confidence is due to strong evidence (multiple studies) and a high level of consensus amongst scientists. 

### Likelihood Terminology
- In climate science/modeling, we are often working with probabilistic findings (X% chance that Y will happen due to Z). The certainty of scientific findings is then described using likelihoods.

- Findings with low likelihood should be treated as less pressing issues because the relationship is less clear.
