Just read the IPCC 2022 adaptation report (policymaker summary). My main takeaway is that they don't really have many detailed guidelines or solutions. They were mainly just talking about climate-awareness, inclusion, community-centric decision making, etc. 

- Long term thinking is essential so that there is no maladaptation. Maladaptation refers to adaptation measures that are based on short-term thinking and are no longer effective after further climate change. These are costly mistakes that must be avoided.
- There are no general perfect solutions that can be deployed globally. Adaptation needs to be tailored for every region/community. 
	- Local leaders should driving the efforts because they know the community's problems best, however they need to work with climate experts to make the best long term decisions. 
	- If possible it should work with the local ecosystem over the long term so that there is a regenerative, self-strengthening natural defense. 
- There is no blanket solution and you need the collaboration and knowledge-sharing of many people and institutions. Every region needs to have it's own leaders that are driving the adaptation efforts, it can't be a one-size-fits-all blanket solution. 

You can't just make an adaptation solution in a vaccum. You need to first look at a region and observe the problems they are facing and the projected climate trends. Only then can you start working to solve the problems of that specific region. If your work is successful, then other regions with similar problems may want pick it up. 

**The main lesson is that with adaptation you have to start locally .**
